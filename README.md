Learning to Borrow â€“ Relation Representation for Without-Mention Entity-Pairs for Knowledge Graph Completion

This repository is for learning-to-Borrow (SuperBorrow) model that integrates text corpus with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs). In particular, SuperBorrow borrows Lexicalised Dependency Paths (LDPs) from the entity-pairs that co-occur in sentencs in the corpus (with-mentions) to represent entity-pairs that do not co-occur in any sentence in the corpus (without-mentions).
